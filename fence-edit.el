;; Fence Edit requires at least GNU Emacs 24.4.

;; This file is not part of GNU Emacs.

;;; Commentary:

;; Fence Edit provides a convenient way to edit the contents of
;; "fenced code blocks" used by markup formats like Markdown in a
;; dedicated window set to the major mode appropriate for its
;; language.
;;
;; Simply bind a key to `fence-edit-code-at-point' and call it from
;; within any code block matching one of the patterns described in
;; `fence-edit-blocks'.  Based on a language symbol extracted from the
;; fence block pattern, the corresponding mode in
;; `fence-edit-lang-modes' will be set for the edit buffer.

;;; Code:
(defcustom fence-edit-lang-modes
  '(("cl" . lisp-interaction-mode))
  "A mapping from markdown language symbols to the modes they should be edited in."
  :group 'fence-edit

  "Alist of regexps matching editable blocks.

Each element takes the form
\(START-REGEXP END-REGEXP LANG-RULE)

Where START- and END-REGEXP are patterns matching the start and end of
the block, respectively.

If LANG-RULE is a symbol, that symbol is assumed to be a language
name.

If LANG-RULE is an integer, it is assumed to be the number of a
capture group to pass to `match-string' to get the language (a capture
group within the START-REGEXP).

If the language value with `-mode' appended to it does not resolve to
a bound function, it will be used to look up a mode in
`fence-edit-lang-modes'.  If the symbol doesn't match a key in
that list, the `fence-edit-default-mode' will be used."
